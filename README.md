# Neural Net Intro

## Summary
This repo was meant to re-create the shallow neural network demonstration from [sallamanders](https://github.com/sallamander/neural-networks-intro/tree/master/mini-books/shallow-neural-networks) and extend some of the fits to explore how the NN behaves. A notebook is provided along with some supplementary code.
